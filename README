Progress towards coding the radiation interaction model

-Utilizes numpy for scientific computing and matplotlib for visualization

-Visualization not yet added

-Not sure if flows from a site to itself should be contrained to 0

-All distance calculation are based on euclidian distance despite the fact that the site's coordinates are in decimal degrees. This was to have consistent units, since the the kd tree seems to be using euclidean distance. Using the haversine formula to calculate distances from the lat/long coordinates there does not match the kd tree indexing. The site's coordinates will likely need to be projected and transformed to meters to have correct units and ensure consistency between the kd tree and inter-site ditances.
